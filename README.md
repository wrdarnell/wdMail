*An Arduino-based Mailbox Notifier using NRF24 Radios*

### Status
Under initial development.  More to come

### Goals
* Send a message to a base station when the mailbox door opens
* Use inexpensive hardware, especially on the mailbox end.
* Be low power.  Solar not being an option where I live
* Have base station send an iMessage or SMS when an alert comes in
* Get notifications when battery gets low
